pullquote: "Recently, a few people told me that I looked good, that I'd lost weight. It made me feel good, then it made me feel bad. It was a compliment, sure. But then I realized it's just something you say to a big guy to get the conversation rolling. It might have even seemed the perfect compliment upon delivery, but it only worked to make me conscious of how I looked, or how I used to look. I just didn't want to hear it. It made me think, though. Had I ever given a compliment that made someone feel worse? Or that had no effect at all? I decided to learn how to deliver good ones. I devised a plan in which I would give a lot of them in a short time and work to figure out exactly how the best compliments worked, and why."
