pullquote: "How many licks does it take to get to the center of Tootsie Roll?

No one really knows. The 116-year-old company, run by one of America's oldest CEOs, has become increasingly secretive over the years, severing nearly all of its connections to the outside world. Tootsie Roll shuns journalists, refuses to hold quarterly earnings calls, and issues crookedly-scanned PDFs for its earnings releases. The last securities industry analyst to maintain coverage of the company stopped last year because it was too hard to get information.
'I think the only way you can get a tour is by jumping over the fence and sneaking in,' said the last analyst to attempt the task, Elliott Schlang of Cleveland firm Great Lakes Review."
