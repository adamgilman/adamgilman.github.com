<p>It started at the lack of real contexual information on the scoreboards for College Football websites.</p>
<p>Some of the things I wanted to see from a College Football scoreboard was</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the team move up or down in the ranking from last week?</li>
<li>Who did they play last week?</li>
<li>Who will they play next week?</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the popular College Football scoreboards did a good job at displaying this infor for me, so I decided to write my own.</p>
<p>For the technically minded there’s actually two sides to the project</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard">Data Collector</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/tree/gh-pages">Web Front End</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard">data collector</a> is written in Python and is mostly contained in the <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/master/collector/create_score_json.py">scores generator</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/master/collector/create_schedule.py">schedule generator</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/tree/gh-pages">web front end</a> is a HTML powered by <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> which handles all of the loading, processing of schedules, scores and building the actualy page you see. It’s an almost blank HTML page before the CoffeeScript get’s going.</p>
<p>There’s two main CoffeeScript components in the app</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/loader.coffee">loader</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/schedule.coffee">schedule</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/loader.coffee">loader</a> has two jobs, the primary one is to go grab all of the json files generated by the <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard">data collector</a> and then signal once all the files are loaded to start the page build. The second is to declare the basic objects like a <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/loader.coffee#L83">Schedule</a>, a collection of all of the <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/loader.coffee#L22">scores</a>, and the current <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/loader.coffee#L1">rank</a>.</p>
<p>Once the loader is finished getting all the needed files, the <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/schedule.coffee#L93">schedule builder</a> takes over. This goes through every ranked team in order and pulls out each game 3 weeks prior and 2 weeks foward and gathers all of the information needed to build out of the schedule page. All of the display complexity is encapsulated into either the <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/schedule.coffee#L28">Game</a> object or the <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/schedule.coffee#L1">Team</a> object.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/main.coffee#L8">templating logic</a> is kept purposefully simply and lets the CoffeeScript data models handle most everything.</p>
